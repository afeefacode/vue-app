# AModal

It's a Modal capsule for vuetifys Modals. Whats the magic about it?

The Modal is by default relatively positioned near its activator.

## Properties

* show
* icon
* title
* beforeClose
* anchorPosition
* screenCentered


### screenCentered

if set to true the Modal is positioned in the middle of the Viewport, like in vuetify's default beavior.
